pysap - Python library for crafting SAP's network protocols packets

Copyright (C) 2014 Core Security Technologies

The library was designed and developed by Martin Gallo from the Security
Consulting Services team of Core Security Technologies.

Version 0.1.5 (XXX 2014)


Overview:
========

SAP Netweaver [1] is a technology platform for building and integrating SAP
business applications. Communication between components uses different network
protocols. While some of them are standard and well-known protocols, others
are proprietaries and public information is not available.

This Python library provides modules for crafting and sending packets using
SAP's NI, Message Server, Router, RFC, SNC, Enqueue and Diag protocols. The
modules are based on Scapy [2] and are based on information acquired at
researching the different protocols and services. Detailed information about
the research can be found at [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7].


Features:
========

This tool counts with the following components:

- SAPNI module
    Scapy class for the SAP NI (Network Interface protocol). It also includes a
    Stream Socket implementation for the SAP NI protocol, as well as a base 
    proxy and server implementations.

- SAPDiag module
    Contain Scapy classes for craft and dissect DiagDP headers, Diag packets 
    and items. The main class is SAPDiag that is in charge of handling 
    compression/decompression of payload items and serve as a container for 
    them.

- SAPDiagItems module
    Some classes for craft and dissect common Diag items.

- SAPDiagClient module
    Basic class for establishing a connection with an application server.

- SAPEnqueue module
	Scapy classes for the Enqueue protocol.

- SAPRouter module
    Scapy classes for the different SAP Router packets (route, control, error
    and admin messages).

- SAPMS module
    Scapy classes for the Message Server protocol.
    
- SAPSNC module
	Basic class to serve as container of SNC Frames found in SAPRouter and
	SAP Diag packets. 

- Examples
    Example and proof of concept scripts to illustrate the use of the different
    modules and protocols: login brute force, gather information on the
    application server, intercept communications, a rogue Diag server
    implementation, test of Denial of Server issues [4], a Message Server
    monitor implementation, listener/messager for Message Server, SAP Router
    internal networks scanner and port forwarder, etc.
	

Installation & Build:
====================

The tool relays on the Scapy [2] library for crafting packets. Epydoc is also
required for building the API documentation. To install the required libraries
use:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Some example scripts has additional required libraries:

	tabulate
	netaddr
	wxPython
	fau_timer (https://code.google.com/p/fau-timer/)

Those libraries can be installed using:

	pip install -r requirements-optional.txt 


Install using Python's setuptools. Installation is as follows:

1) python setup.py test

2) python setup.py install

Some scapy installations also requires the following steps:
    Edit the file supersocket.py (located for example on 
    	/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scapy/supersocket.py)
    Add the line: from scapy.packet import Padding
