This section of the documentation covers the installation process of pysap.


Installation with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing pysap is simple with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_, just run the
following command on a terminal::

    $ pip install pysap

Some example scripts has additional required libraries:

- ``tabulate``
- ``netaddr``
- `wxPython <https://www.wxpython.org/>`_
- `fau_timer <https://github.com/seecurity/mona-timing-lib>`_

Some of those extra libraries can be installed with `pip`_ running the following
command::

    $ pip install pysap[examples]

`Sphinx <https://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ is also required for building the API
documentation. For installing it use::

    $ pip install pysap[docs]


Manual installation

The tool relays on the `Scapy <http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/>`_ version 2.3.3
library for crafting packets. To install the required libraries use::

Once you have downloaded pysap's sources, you can install it easily using
the Python's ``setuptools`` script provided:
