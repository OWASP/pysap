User guide
==========

The following parts of the documentation contains some background information about
`pysap <https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/pysap>`_, as well as some
step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring and using pysap.


Projects using pysap
--------------------

The following projects, tools and repositories are known to be using pysap:

* `HoneySAP <https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/HoneySAP>`_: HoneySAP is a
  low-interaction research-focused honeypot specific for SAP services. HoneySAP uses
  pysap as a library in order to craft and parse different protocol network packets.

* `SAP dissection plug-in for Wireshark <https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/SAP-Dissection-plug-in-for-Wireshark>`_:
  This Wireshark plugin provides dissection of SAP's ``NI``, Message Server,
  ``Router``, ``Diag``, ``Enqueue``, ``IGS``, ``SNC`` and ``HDB`` protocols. The Wireshark
  plug-in makes use of pysap in order to craft packets used during unit tests.

* `SAP Message Server research <https://github.com/gelim/sap_ms>`_: Exploit proof of
  concept code for two attacks against the Message Server service:

  * Logon Group (transparent) Hijacking
  * BeTrusted

* `SAP Gateway RCE exploit PoCs <https://github.com/chipik/SAP_GW_RCE_exploit>`_:
  Exploit proof of concept code for ACL misconfigurations in the SAP Gateway that
  leads to a Remote Command Execution (RCE).

* `John the Ripper's pse2john script <https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/run/pse2john.py>`_:
  Script to export PSE's encryption PIN into a format that can be cracked with
  John the Ripper.

Installation
------------

This section of the documentation covers the installation process of pysap.


Installation with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing pysap is simple with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_, just run the
following command on a terminal::

    $ pip install pysap

Some example scripts has additional required libraries:

- ``tabulate``
- ``netaddr``
- ``cryptography``
- ``requests``
- `wxPython <https://www.wxpython.org/>`_
- `fau_timer <https://github.com/seecurity/mona-timing-lib>`_

Some of those extra libraries can be installed with `pip`_ running the following
command::

    $ pip install pysap[examples]


Manual installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tool relays on the `Scapy <https://scapy.net/>`_ library for crafting
packets. To install the required libraries use::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Once you have downloaded pysap's sources, you can install it easily using
the Python's ``setuptools`` script provided:

1) ``python setup.py test``

2) ``python setup.py install``


Scapy installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For installing `Scapy`_, see the official `installation documentation <https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ for each platform:

  - `Linux <https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-scapy-v2-x>`_.
  - `macOS <http://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#mac-os-x>`_.
  - `Windows <https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#windows>`_.
